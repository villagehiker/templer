# About the Casestudy

This case study describes the conversion of a 10-year-old hand-coded website to templer. The site contained more than 500 pages created over a period of 10 years. While page looked similar to the user, the html and css suffered from many patches to make the site site more or less adaptive to desktop, table and smart-phone browsers.
