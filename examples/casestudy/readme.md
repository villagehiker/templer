# Templer Casestudy for Real-World Website

This case study describes the conversion of a 10-year-old hand-coded website to the Templer static-site generator. 

## About the Casestudy

The original site contained more than 500 pages created during 10 years. While most pages looked similar to the user, the HTML and CSS suffered from inconsistent patching. Many of the pages used different css files to force the HTML and CSS into adaptive and responsive behaviors. Some pages used HTML 4, others used XHTML. More recent ones used HTML 5. Maintenance became a nusiance. The website consisted of text files, images and CSS. It used no javascript. 

## Case Study Elements

The case study describes:

* templer configuration file
* include files
* a single template layout
* text input files in HTML and markdown formats
* images

## Software Versions

The Templer installation uses version 1.2 running on Perl version 5.16.0. Perl was installed on MacOS Sierra using PerlBrew, not touching the system Perl.
